This ruby script demonstrates the apparently-absurd fact underlying the Monty Hall problem (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem).

There are three doors.  Two doors have a goat behind them.  One door has a new car behind it.  The contestant chooses a door.  Monty Hall opens a second door, revealing a goat.  The contestant must choose whether or not to switch between the two other doors.

Running this yields:

	$ ruby goats.rb 
	By not switching doors, you win 33335304 times out of 100000000.
	By switching doors, you win 66664697 times out of 100000000.
